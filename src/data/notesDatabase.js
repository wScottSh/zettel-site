The term \"fight or flight\" refers to the two options ([[201909011021 Safety Dance swimming story]]) we have to avoid the threat. This physiological state efficiently allows for either standing ground for a fight or fleeing, depending on what your specific circumstance calls for.\n\nThe physical symptoms are:\n\n1. **Dilated pupils** - This allows for more visual information to be processed, prepping the body to have as much information at its disposal for better/faster decision making\n2. **Flushed/pale skin** - Blood flow is redirected to the muscles and organs, prepping to either fight or flee\n3. **Rapid heart rate** - Your body needs additional energy and oxygen. This helps with that\n4. **Trembling** - As muscles become tense and primed for action, you might start trembling\n\nIt's important to note that in today's much calmer society, most stress responses are caused by scenarios where neither fighting or fleeing are the best options. Even perceived threats ([[202003180839 Neuro-Emotional Complex]]) can trigger a fight or flight response.\n\nLike most physical responses, the fight or flight response is useful in acute situations. But because of the intense nature of the symptoms, when it becomes chronic, the state is no longer beneficial ([[201908301038 Chronic inflammation is the real problem]]) and is an indicator of a deeper problem that should be addressed.\n\n202402020746\nCould could plunging everyday (an antifragility building measure) also be counted as a dirty of chronic stress?

The concept is simultaneously simple and disciplined.\n\n![[202006031416 Zettelkasten One Pager.jpeg]]\n### The elements of this note taking method\n\n1. The slip-box (zettelkasten) for storing permanent notes\n2. A bibliography storage location for writing references to interesting tidbits within books, articles, etc.\n3. An inbox for fleeting notes that is emptied and processed daily\n\nThe process of collecting relevant notes and processing them into permanent 'zetels' (notes) mimics how the brain makes connections. It's about increasing the retrieval ability of knowledge. This method increased the writing output and quality of Luhmann significantly. He wrote 58 books and countless articles in his lifetime, an average of two published books per year of his professional adult life.\n\n### The process of this workflow\n\n- Take a fleeting note on whatever is available\n- Put fleeting note into the inbox\n- Convert that note into a permanent note (zetel)\n    - This is about putting it into my own words\n    - Keep the note to more than approximately 100 words\n    - Abstract the context to be a useful unique single thought\n- Find other notes to connect this new note to with literal connections\n- Delete the original fleeting note\n\n## Citations\n\nhttps://zettelkasten.de/\n[[201908211333 How to take smart notes]]\n[[201908300504 T-shaped person]]"

This is called the *onboarding* phase ([[Actionable Gamification]]). Typically there is no way to fail ([[How I Got My Mom to Play Through Plants vs. Zombies]]) during this phase.\n\nFor example, in *Plants vs. Zombies*, the player goes the motions of placing shooters to take out the zombies. But the minimum number allowed to place is more than enough to dispatch the zombies that come toward the house.\n\nThe player is given the basic tools that will be used in the core gameplay. They are allowed use the new tools in a safe environment where it is impossible to fail, but still interesting.\n\nThis isn't about the interesting parts of the game (ie. the strategy), this is about teaching the mechanics of the game (ie. how to place a plant in a lane so it can take out oncoming zombies).\n\n- [[201908300607 Dominion Game Shift Sparks Endgame Rush]]"

There's always information you'll miss, but what you do get is good enough for your purposes, and it's always guided by interests (ie. relevant to your current train of thought).\n\nTheoretically, you can bounce around the book so much that you effectively read the entire text.

It will give you joy, happiness, peace and contentment as you live the standards of the gospel that is so important. \n\nFor only as you follow the savior can you have peace in life, by sharing another persons burdens and being an example in all you do, carrying on your responsibilities as you serve in the kingdom. \n\nBut also it will protect you against the pressures of the world and the temptations of the adversary that would try to take you away from receiving these blessings. It will be a shield and a protection to you and guide and direct your path as you follow it in your life for righteous purposes. \n\nYou came to earth at a very special time, when the fullness of the gospel is once again upon the earth with its Priesthood power to bind on earth and in heaven those ordinances that are so essential in man's eternal progression. \n\nThis is not by chance that you are here, you are here for a purpose to help move the work forward and declare the gospel of Jesus Christ to all that you can. You will help build the kingdom in preparation for the Second Event of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nYou are from the loins of Ephraim and have this precious blood in your veins. This gives you the rights, privileges and blessings that were given to the Prophets Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to enjoy. This will bless your life along with your posterity and give you guidance and direction through the Priesthood.\n\nNow, Scott, look for guidance, light and truth in all you can by reading good books. Learn wisdom and knowledge by seeking ways that will come to you. Most of all seek wisdom and knowledge by reading the scriptures daily. Ponder them in your mind, pray about them, and learn to live by them and accept them. You will realize that Jesus is the redeemer of all mankind, and what a great blessing this will be in your life and you will be able to expound this in many ways. \n\nYou are promised that the mysteries of heaven will open unto you, if you will accept the scriptures and teach them in your life. You will find that you will be called to positions through out your life, you will develop your gifts and talents and be able to teach these things in readiness. \n\nYou have a quick mind and can retain what you read and you will be able to use this in many ways as you serve. \n\nThe Priesthood will be important in your life and you will find you will be advanced therein and have many opportunities to express your feelings and enjoy the blessings that Heavenly Father has given unto you.\n\nYou will have the blessings of the temple in your life. For therein you will have the blessings of becoming a co-creator with Heavenly Father in bringing forth His spirit children. You will love and cherish your wife and treat her with courtesy and kindness. You will teach your children to walk uprightly before the Lord and they will bless your life by giving you support in the things you need throughout your life.\n\nNow remember the power of prayer, for this is a very precious thing in your life. Submit yourself unto Heavenly Father night and morning, giving Him thanks for the blessings that you receive. The decisions that you need to make in your life go to Him for guidance and direction and you will learn that He will help you and give you the guidance that you need as you learn to listen to the whispering of the Spirit.\n\nThere are certain commandments that are given unto you to bless your life in temporal things here upon the earth. Honor the Sabbath day and keep it holy, pay your tithes and offerings, and keep your body and mind clean, pure and wholesome. The Lord will bless you with the temporal things in life; there will be an abundance there that will help you in your work in the Kingdom through out your life. \n\nYou are promised your home will be a home of refuge, for all those who are oppressed, a home of comfort, a home with peace and contentment that you will enjoy along with your family. The Spirit of the Lord will dwell there and bless your life.\n\nRemember your heritage and the things that you have been taught, this will give you guidance and direction that will help you through the trials and tribulation that will come to you. \n\nAs you follow the Prophets and listen to their counsel and guidelines you will find inspiration and direction in all you need as you serve.\n\nThrough your faithfulness and obedience you are promised the blessings of the first resurrection, you will come forth with those who have prepared themselves for this great blessing. \n\nThis is your blessing to work and strive for, which I give unto you by virtue of the Priesthood I bear and in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\n\nQuentin J.

A and B, where B always comes after A. The events (cause) of A *always* lead to the outcome (effect) of B. If B doesn't occur after A, then it's not a cause and effect relationship. A will 100% of the time result in B.\n\nFor example, an acorn is what's necessary for an oak tree to exist. There was an acorn first (A), and later that acorn had grown into an oak tree (B). The acorn grew into an oak. Cause and effect. Simple - but not true.\n\nThe '**producer-product**' relationship is more elaborate ([[201908281519 Differences that don't make a difference]]). There are multiple producers that contribute in the creation of a product. \n\nFor example, an acorn in an ocean does not result in an oak tree growing. Nor does an acorn create an oak tree in a desert. There are more \"producers\" than just the seed. Air, water, soil quality and availablility, an acorn, sunlight, temperature, humidity, etc. All are producers of the product, in this case an oak tree.\n\nThe relationship is more complicated because it focuses on the *complex system* as a whole rather than as a *closed natural system*.\n\n1. **Possible producers** - Whether or not the producer is even possibly a producer of the product. For example, an egg is not a producer of an acorn, so it does not fit with in the *possible* category. An acorn is in the possible category because it *can* create an oak tree, but sometimes it does not.\n2. **Potential producers** - This is a redundancy factor coming from a slightly different angle. An acorn fits into the *potential* category when it has been shown that multiple acorns have become oak trees, but *at least one* acorn has failed to produce an oak tree. Thus it's potential is greater than a possible category.\n3. **Probable producers** - This is a fairly complex category, which is about the *probability* that the producer will indeed contribute to the creation of the product. This is determined from average statistical probability of the base, and any variation from that base.\n\n- Source: [[On Purposeful Systems]] - p.22"

Dash, slash and shoot. Dashing zips the character across the screen quickly in an invulnerable state - it's good for getting into and out of the fray quickly. Slashing is close combat melee with no limit to the number of attacks. And lastly, there's the shooting, which is very limited and recharges slowly across time.\n\nBecause the player has very little defense, it makes most sense to stay in the periphery and shoot. But because the bullets are so limited, this is not a repeatable strategy. So the player is then forced to dive into the fray to dash 'n slash.\n\nThe one mechanic that makes this interesting instead of broken is that the bullets regenerate much *much* faster when the player successfully slashes an enemy.\n\nSo the strategy becomes shoot, dash, slash, dash, shoot. A perpetual dance ([[201908281326 Chris Crawford conversation model]]) between the relative safety of shooting and the high risk/reward of dashing and slashing to regenerate the bullets. // [[201909041525 Saw shaped difficulty curve]]\n\nI think this works because the bullets are so powerful and safe - but ultimately boring in comparison. It makes the tradeoff worth it to dash in and risk dying. It allows the player to choose when to practice their mastery of the dash and slash mechanic, and when to fall back and take a breather.\n\nIt rewards aggressive gameplay, but places that onus on the player. It makes the game hard but fair because the player was the one that decided to take the risk.\n\n[It didn't start this way][4], but the design changed ([[201908221717 Four ways to fix problems]]) late in development and solved several game mechanics.\n\n- [4]: #cite\n- [[201908300607 Dominion Game Shift Sparks Endgame Rush]]\n- [[201909061449 Space Invaders - Design Icons]] GMTK - Space Invaders\n- [[202003072131 Yin and Yang balance everything]]"

By introducing a reward for \"good behavior\" - whatever that behavior might be - those students very quickly stop doing the positive behavior without being given the reinforcing reward.\n\nThe positive behavior stops once the rewards stop. There is no incentive to do good.\n\nThe implication is that rewards, while positive in the short term, ultimately rob the students of the ability to demonstrate those positive behaviors for the inherent \"right\" reasons.\n\nAcross time, those students develop a lifestyle around expecting rewards for everything, and will even stop their own personal growth if a sufficient external reward is not received.\n\n202009231926: The scary part is that I believe we've worked ourselves into a corner with our rewards based school system and the amount of rewards focused games (the gamified world).\n\nSource: [[Punished by Rewards]]"

However they are extremely powerful and must be carefully considered if [designed][5] into a system. They can easily spin out of control and incentivize [unintentional negative behaviors][6].\n\nHinted [here][1], a good reward is one that offers something inherent to the system it is part of. For example, rewarding the player with very few bullets in *Hyper Light Drifter* to ease the difficulty of the combat only temporarily. This means the player must get good at the intended behavior - slashing and dashing - to get the reward - shooting.\n\nA poor reward would be something akin to Kohn's warning. Giving gold stars for \"good behavior\" at school incentivizes the student to practice surface level positive traits, but the reward is completely divorced from good behavior. A dance between being given candy and being nice to people is, as a whole, not a positive reward structure. \n\n<!--This is the key point §202003122130-->\nIt is never a problem to have a short burst of bullets, as the player must develop the correct skills (the [combat dance][2]) to get them.\n\nBut it *can* be a problem to give out candy for correct answers at church because the intention of being in the scriptures should be about building a testimony, and candy has nothing to do with coming closer to Christ.\n\nSource: [[201909011033 Punished by Rewards]]\n[1]: [[201909011002 Bloodborne rewards players correctly]]\n[2]: [[201908281326 Chris Crawford conversation model]]\n[3]: [[201909010956 Rewards rob people of doing good inherently]]\n[4]: [[201908271208 Hyper Light Drifter incentivizes reckless play]]\n[5]: [[201909161210 Zettelkasten surprises with new ideas]]\n[6]: [[202003110833 Second Order Thinking]]\n[[202004021212 Hyper Light Drifter]]"

In *Dark Souls*, the player could create an opening to riposte by deflecting attacks at the correct moment. The shield acts as a static defense, but also acts as a mobile offensive enabler.\n\nIn *Bloodborne* though, there is no static defense. And the gun does no deflecting. But by shooting the enemy - which causes very little damage - the enemy can be knocked back, allowing for a riposte.\n\nThis is like someone driving with the horn and the gas pedal instead of the brakes. To make it in the world of *Bloodborne*, the player must accept that there is very little defense and caution in this harsh and aggressive world.\n\nThe **Regain system** is useful for when you *do* get hit. Essentially, for a very short period of time after being hit, the player can attack the enemy back to regain some of their lost health. This is a unique reward because the cautionary behavior is to retreat and take more precaution.\n\nBut because of the Regain [reward structure][1], the player is incentivized to immediately attack back in an aggressive factor, despite the large risks involved in doing so.\n\n[1]: [[201909011009 Not all rewards are bad]]\n[2]: [[201908271208 Hyper Light Drifter incentivizes reckless play]]\n[3]: [[Dark Souls]]\n[4]: [[Bloodborne]]"

Which leads me to believe that there is a generalizable principle here.\n\nThe *antibodies* are created to attack a specific toxin's chemical pattern. But sometimes they extend themselves to attack other, very similar chemical patterns. Which can be tissue. On a small scale, this seems helpful to be overly cautious. But on a large scale, it causes autoimmune disease.\n\nThe generalizable principle could be that cross-pollination of ideas or attention is a positive skill to develop. This makes you a polymath. But potentially on a large scale, this could cause problems. Blending the lines where they don't make sense - like an antibody attacking self tissue without discernment - has potential for cascading negative effects.

Meaning, it can not only take a few punches, but *welcomes* them because it comes out stronger on the other side. Like a Hydra ([[202004172123 How to fight a Hydra]]).\n\nHowever, this comes with a less often touted caveat. This \"benefits from chaos\" superpower only works up to a threshold. Beyond that threshold, the chaotic input is too strong for the system and negative consequences occur.\n\nThis reminds me of the entire premise of the book [[201909031409 Grow or Die]], where it's shown that biological systems are built to ingest (random) things as a function of living. Everything from single celled organisms to complex mammals must consume external things or they will die.\n\nBut similar to the **antifragility threshold**, there is also a [**consumption threshold**][4]. The two are very similar feeling.\n\nEssentially, if the foreign object that the organism is trying to consume is too complicated/large for the organism, then it ends up causing damage - so protection mechanisms are put in place to avoid that damage.\n\nIn the case of a single celled organism, that might be something too large for itself to digest ([[201908281313 Antibodies and NECs guard your health]]). For a human, that might be too complicated of a concept to internalize. In any case, there is a threshold under which an organism can safely consume a foreign (chaotic) something without problems.

As we play them, we give our inputs ([as verbs][4]) in the form of a question, and the game responds with an answer. Without our interaction, the game patiently listens for our question.\n\nWhen the NPC AI interacts with the player avatar, the game is then asking us a question (again, in the form of a verb), and we respond if we are \"listening\".\n\nThis perpetual questioning - rather than making statements at eachother - makes these games tantalizing to our problem-solving-wired brains.

Those levels can be checked via bloodwork. This is done by:\n\n- **Step 1**: Remove the top three autoimmune offenders - gluten, dairy, sugar - for 3 weeks. All of it, 100%. Be sure that what you're eating instead is 100% organic, non-GMO to be as safe from additional toxins as possible. This allows the gut permeability wall to heal.\n- **Step 2**: If you aren't feeling well after the three weeks avoiding the top 3 - which is plenty long enough for the gut wall to heal - then avoid all of the other foods that could be causing problems for an additional 3 weeks. These would be all the other foods that your body has created antibodies for, like tomatoes, etc.\n- **Step 3**: If still not feeling well, check into deep toxicity levels ([mercury][2], etc.).\n- **Step 4**: At this point, your gut wall should be healed (it heals very quickly), and you can re-introduce clean versions of the eliminated foods. Except for gluten - that stuff's super bad for you.\n\nConceptually, all autoimmune diseases are a function of too much inflammation in the body for too long of a time period. Calm that immune response down, and create an environment where the [antibody][3] response isn't triggered again, then your body can permanently heal from autoimmune.\n\n[[201908281024 The Autoimmune Fix]] book bibliography\n[2]: [[201909091335 Biological consumption threshold doesnt prevent small doses]] mercury biomagnification\n[3]: [[201909031304 Cross-pollination of ideas makes you a polymath]]"

This is simply because it's too damaged to heal quickly enough. It needs a break to be able to [recover][1].\n\nThis threshold is called the *loss of oral tolerance*. Before this threshold is reached, the intestinal wall can withstand being damaged on a minor level. This is a [*robust system*][2] (one that neither benefits from or is damaged by general chaos).\n\nOnce the [threshold][3] of the loss of oral tolerance has been reached, you officially have \"*leaky gut*\", officially known as pathogenic intestinal permeability.\n\nLeaky gut is the number one thing to [try and heal][1] to reverse autoimmune responses. It's the macromolecules from food getting into the bloodstream that cause the chronic [inflammation][4] which cascades into autoimmune.\n\n[1]: [[201909091502 Heal Autoimmune Disease by Fixing Diet]]\n[2]: [[Antifragile]]\n[3]: [[201909031354 Antifragile to a threshold]]\n[4]: [[201908300544 Autoimmune symptoms are the weak link]]"

It's a built-in way to incentivize the player to face their fears a second time when they are more vulnerable than when they approached the fear the first time. <!--201912062349 I believe this is the real magic of the Souls style difficulty games-->\n\nThe player collects \"souls\" when they kill enemies. These souls are used as the sole currency (see what I did there?) of the game - purchasing items, upgrades, leveling up, etc. They're very important, and they're not easy to get.\n\nWhen your player's avatar is killed, all of your souls are dropped on the ground where you were killed. Rather than immediately disappearing (like in the Sonic games), they stay on the ground for you to come back and pick up later. This is a fantastic boon, but creates the following interesting dynamic.\n\nInherently, the souls will drop at a very difficult location with difficult enemies - this is a given due to the fact that you were killed there. This means that the player is drawn back to the difficult area when they are at a higher risk state.\n\nThey are more vulnerable because the souls disappear forever if the player dies a second time before picking them up again.\n\nIn general, if something is too hard you in life, you typically don't come back until you're strong enough or practiced enough to actually win. This requires that you face those feares immediately after because the loss of the souls is greater than the fear of risking death via challenging task again.\n\n<!--§201912062351: I want to see examples of this in real life.

Anything that have multiple moving parts that are dependent on each other can be modeled well with these.\n\nThere are four elements of a Petri Net:\n\n1. States (Places)\n2. Transitions\n3. Arcs\n4. Tokens\n\n**States** are represented as circles, and are for marking discrete states. For example: On, off, a queue, etc. They hold tokens inside of them.\n\n**Transitions** are represented as either Lines or Boxes. They mark a verb in the state machine. Anything that will change the current state to another state.\n\n**Arcs** are represented as an arrow that points from a *State* to a *Transition* or vice versa. These are what make up the logical flow of the entire Net.\n\n**Tokens** are represented as little dots that sit within the states. They mark the current state of the operating machine, and pass from state to state when an intermediate transition is \"fired\".\n\nThe value of using a Petri Net is that both the State and Verbs (Transitions) are treated as first class citizens. This makes them useful in graphically describing conditional logic.\n\n[[201908281326 Chris Crawford conversation model]] crawford conversations"

His claim was that his slip-box would surprise him with new findings as he would add and query notes.\n\nThere are several aspects that enabled this. The structure of the notes as a [flat hierarchy][3] (rather than stored via category or folder) allowed for a higher-order of organization.\n\nBy following an [atomized][2] note structure within each individual note, as well as a unique ID for each note, permanent connections between notes were made ad-hoc and unstructured akin to the internet's hyperlinking.\n\nThis structure allowed the zettelkasten to grow with an unhindered [independence][4] while still being query-able. Serendipitous connections would surprise Luhmann with ideas that were not explicity added into the slip-box by himself.\n\nSource: [luhmann.surge.sh](luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes)\n\n[1]: [[201908211326 Zettelkasten Method]]\n[2]: [[201909161325 Single idea zettels boost brain connections]]\n[3]: [[201909161326 Save your notes in a flat-hierarchy]]\n[4]: [[201909161327 Give your zettelkasten independence]]\n[[201909161328 Intent of query changes output]]"

The lack of explicit context ([[201908211326 Zettelkasten Method]]) means the idea proves its worth through its connections to other notes - especially the 2nd+ order ([[202003110833 Second Order Thinking]]) connections.\n\nThe notes themselves should be concise, meaty, and to the point. They should also preferably be divorced from one single context, which allows them to be connected to other notes - potentially in another domain entirely - and still have meaning.\n\nContextual divorce is possible when you fully understand the idea you are capturing as opposed to re-phrasing or copy/pasta-ing the idea for later reference. This requires more upfront effort, but also increases the chances of long term retention, retrieval and value.\n\nAs connections are made from note to note, the atomized and decontextualized nature of the notes create a tightly knit mesh of notes. The immediately connected notes (first connections) will always make the most sense, but the magic happens in the notes that are further out. As Luhmann said, the results of querying the zettelkasten can surprise you!\n\nSource: http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes"

Checking them off daily (or whatever interval) will create a habit chain (Seinfeld habit chain #zt) called a Streak. This is like every other app.\n\nWhat's unique in Habitica is the introduction of a Health bar and an Experience bar.\n\nThe Experience is tied to leveling up the avatar, like most other games. Every time you complete a task, you are given some Experience points for that activity. As your level increases, the amount of experience points required to achieve the next level increases. This means you are awarded with level-ups at the beginning of the process, and you have to work harder for levels as you are more established in the system. This is fairly standard game mechanics fare.\n\nThe Health bar is where the magic lies. In this particular case, anytime you fail to check off a daily habit (or similar) you are docked *HP* rather than losing *XP*. Which is nice in that you are losing something that is meant to decrease anyway - it's accepted that you can lose health points in games. But in addition to only losing a secondary stat, the amount of HP you have is always at a maximum of 50 points. Even when you level up, this max HP does not increase.\n\nThe best way to refill your HP is to level up, which means that it becomes more and more important to actually follow your posted habits as the game progresses and you gain levels. Eventually you will hit a point where you either get good at your habits (so not to die) or you remove habits from your list (so not to be accountable to them).\n\nEither is a solid option for keeping you focused on the optimal number of habits to be juggling and developing at any one time. Add a few in the beginning until you've mastered them. Then add some more, and master them. Then add some more ([[201909041545 Mario and new game mechanics]]).\n\nThis is a perfect example of the system itself incentivizing the desired behavior for an audience that may not necessarily already be good at that specific behavior. The default no-nonsense strategy is to master a few habits at a time. Brilliant.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[201909100919 Souls mechanic in Dark Souls]] dark souls mechanics\n- [[201909011009 Not all rewards are bad]] hyper light drifter safety dance\n- [[201909010948 Aggressive gameplay earns big rewards]]\n- [[201912041959 Habitica's mechanic for habit growth]]\n- [[Habitica]]"

I noticed that the fully established habits (like taking my supplements for 15 days straight), no longer give me experience points. I still get Gold, but no XP.\n\nThis is interesting because it requires you to keep adding new un-established habits to your list if you're to keep leveling up. Since you still lose health bit by bit and can only gain it back via a level-up, it means that you have to keep pushing yourself by upping your game.\n\nSubtle game mechanics that incentivize the right kind of growth in habit building.

This means that you spend your time pushing your limits and retreating to safety in the [saw-like pattern][2] of growth repeatedly until your skill is large enough to consider \"developed.\"\n\nIn a normal conversation, this is done through questions and assertions. Both serve the purpose of pushing upward on the graph, stepping slightly into vulnerability. Speaking means you could say the wrong thing.\n\nThen you can fall back into the safety realm and allow the other party to do the speaking while you listen. This is not as vulnerable, and allows you to formulate another assertion or question to push up into the vulnerable realm once again.\n\nThe kinds of conversations people have matter, because they will only be able to fully engage in conversations they are well enough equipped to participate in. Anything else will be too 'scary' or 'boring.'\n\n[1]: [[201908242228 Conceptually conversing with the world]]\n[2]: [[201909041525 Saw shaped difficulty curve]] Saw-shaped safety dance progression"

I don't know that they are detrimental to the system, but I am documenting them because I find them interesting.\n\nBecause you get less XP from more established habits ([[201912041959 Habitica's mechanic for habit growth]]), the system incentivizes you to focus on the habits that are less established. This is good.\n\nBut it also means you start prioritizing which habits to do at the end of a day when not everything can get done. For example, I haven't done my exercises for physical therapy yet, nor will I get both sets done.\n\nMy HP will be depleted if I don't do *any* of them. But I can write a zetel (a habit I'm really bad at) to get a bunch of points to level up before midnight. Then I can take the hit for the things I haven't done yet.\n\nSimilarly, in the to-do list (the one-off catergory), I created some todos several weeks back. They are horribly red because I haven't done anything with them yet. The redder it is, the more points I get. So I'm somewhat incentivized to create todos and *not* do them so I can get more points.\n\nWeird.\n\n[[201912092011 Gaming Habitica Can Misplace Focus]]\n[[Habitica]]"

By removing the rules, kids can then experiment and build their own foundation. It feels like this is a kind of \"hard but good\" route.\n\nBut this is a misnomer. For you to be able to experiment with the rules, you have to have rules set up in the first place. Without opposition ([[202007221448 Life's ups and downs are normal]]) - or at least the potential for it - in the form of agency, the structure we rely on would cease to exist. // 2 Nephi 2:11-12 ([[202003051122 2 Nephi 2 - Freedom of choice]])\n\nIt's important to have expectations set early on - yes, rules - so that your kids have an edge to push up against and test. There is no ability to \"experiment upon His word\" if there is no word to experiment upon. // Alma 32:27\n\nThis is why games have tutorials ([[202007221448 Life's ups and downs are normal]])  - to establish the rules.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[202002260919 Don't let others control your career path]]\n- [[201908222154 How I Got My Mom to Play Through Plants vs. Zombies]]\n- [[202003051032 2 Nephi - Compiled Previous Notes]]\n- [[202003072131 Yin and Yang balance everything]]\n- [[201909171048 Hide-and-seek in rats]]"

I have opinions about how the [cry it out method][2] is not compatible with peaceful parenting or unschooling. I agree in principle, but it has proven difficult to put Hawk to bed when he doesn't want to go to sleep.\n\nThe insight: I should be creating the right environment and setting an example for Hawk to choose to go to sleep on his own, rather than me \"putting him down.\" This is obviously much easier said than done, considering the large amount of stress I've felt due to the immense amount of time it sometimes takes him to slow down and sleep.\n\nBut by stripping myself of the responsibility of *making him sleep*, I can let him wind himself down at the pace he wants. I do this by **creating the right environment** (*turning the lights off and putting on the white noise*) and **setting an example** (*laying down*). Then I let him come to the conclusion that it's a good thing to lay down and sleep.\n\n> 202007021219: This eventually proved to be not enough example for a 1.5 year old. Laying down might have given him the cues that it was nap time, but he wasn't learning how to sleep *on his own*. We ended up using the [[202312211058 Sleepeasy Solution]] book to get him sleeping through the night.\n\nI found that by implementing and following GTD, I was not stressed about the lost time. My happiness was contingent on my productivity earlier in the day, not his behavior. I was [[owning the problem]] #zt when it was his problem to own.\n\nThis is [[doing hard things]] #zt as a parent, but it feels right.\n\nThe next step is to help him figure out how to be okay alone so he can start to put himself to sleep.\n\n## Citations\n\n[[202002281249 Beyond the Cry-it-Out Method]]\n[[201909061513 Getting Things Done]]\n[[202003112238 How Level Design Can Tell a Story - Game Maker's Toolkit#^ae1287]]\n[[202003131332 Growing Up Unschooling with Jayn Coburn#^f8bfa8]] - Controlling sabotages efforts"

There is a focus on the learner over the content. As such it incorporates holistic approaches, such as [Learner Personas][3] (as opposed the User Personas).\n\nBecause there is a strong focus on the consumer of the content of the material, it relies heavily on [agile methodology][9] over more traditional waterfall management. It seems like being *Scrum Certified* will be helpful here.\n\n> [Angus T Jones, the American Actor, said; “everything is a learning experience” and that means learning experience designers have unlimited potential in the real world.][5]\n\n- [Day in the life of LXD][6] Rebecca Row\n\n[\"Meaning\"][8] is created when connections are formed between different experiences. Like my zettelkasten. When things have meaning, we remember them more, and so we can recall them better. Connecting experiences (the more *natural* the experience, the better) are the basis of actual learning.\n\n## Example Learner Persona:\n\n### Questions to ask \n\n- What is your job role?\n- Are you a manager?\n- How many years have you been with this organization?\n- Have you changed roles within the organization?\n- How would you rate your tech-savviness?\n- Do you prefer learning online or through face-to-face training?\n- Are you an early bird or a late riser?\n- Are you involved in volunteer work organized by our company?\n- What do you do in your free time?\n\n### Leaner Profile for Burt\n\n> Burt, 43 years old, he has been with your company for six years. He’s a manager in the support department, overseeing five staff. He is extremely tech-savvy and loves to learn about new technologies in his free time. Burt learns best after work hours and prefers to access learning through his mobile device on his commute home. He volunteers his time twice each year to help with charity events organized by your organization.\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: https://learningexperiencedesign.com/fundamentals-of-learning-experience-design/what-is-learning-experience-design/\n[2]: https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/learning-experience-design-best-resources\n[3]: https://trainingindustry.com/articles/content-development/user-centered-design-through-learner-personas/\n[4]: https://trainingindustry.com/articles/content-development/the-modern-learner-and-learning-experience-design/\n[5]: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learning-experience-design-the-most-valuable-lessons\n[6]: https://www.sixredmarbles.com/blog-red/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-learning-experience-designer/\n[7]: https://www.salary.com/research/salary/listing/learning-experience-designer-salary\n[8]: [[202003041051 Make learning fun for eager minds]]\n[9]: [[202009111519 Agile Methodology]]"

It means that we should be focusing on making *connections between things* more than any other activity.\n\nThis can be done in many ways, but the most natural is to just live life and experience things. Our brains are [hardwired to find meaning][2] in data, then to make connections between all of that data. This is the basis of the #unschooling philosophy.\n\nHowever, anything that has the following elements will foster learning:\n\n1. Experience\n2. Meaningful connections\n\nThe trick is to optimize for experiences and meaningful connections. // [[202003041051 Make learning fun for eager minds]]\n\n## Citations\n\n- [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=855Now8h5Rs #zt\n- [2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c1lqFXHvqI #zt\n- §202003131334 -[[Growing Up Unschooling with Jayn Coburn]]"

But because learning is the responsibility of the learner ([[201908242217 Struggle in learning solidifies knowledge]]), the focus should be in optimizing the environment in which the learner operates so their learning experience can be fruitful.\n\n### Example\n\n- One way to not optimize for lerning is compulsory education. Buy removing the learner's agency, you take away their desire to make connections. Connections may be created despite the compulsion, but the lack of desire on the learner's part is a strong factor of what makes learning work. ^97169c\n- Unschooling philosophy is the extreme example of placing the onus of learning directly on the learner. Everything they experience will be meaningful because it was their choice to experience it. Even if it doesn't look like a more traditional educational experience, the highly optimized meaningful connections outweigh the downsides.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[201908281326 Chris Crawford conversation model]]"

For example, if I know the photo was taken in December of 1986 or 1987 but no other details, then the date would look something like 198x12xxxxxx. \n\nThere are some two letter codes that can fit if I'm unsure, but have an educated guess.\n\n- **Winter** - `wi`\n- **Spring** - `sp`\n- **Summer** - `su`\n- **Fall** - `fa`\n- **Night** - `pm`\n- **Day** - `am`\n- **Early** - `e`\n- **Mid** - `d`\n- **Late** - `l`\n\nThat same date can be written as something like 198d12xxamxx. Meaning it was taken in the mid-80s, in December, sometime in the light part of the day.\n\nA parser has enough information to place the chronology of this photo somewhere on a fuzzy continuum. \n\n### Unique Identifier\n\nInside the curly braces is a unique ID. Starting at 00001 and going up as high as they ever go. It's prefaced with a two letter code signifying what kind of media it is.\n\n- **Developed Photo** - `ph`\n- **Slide** - `sl`\n- **B&W Negative** - `bw`\n- **Color Negative** - `cn`\n- **Digital** - `dg`\n\n- {ph00453}\n- {dg09382}\n- {sl00002}\n\n### Caption\n\nThe caption is a short description of what's in the photo. Think what will be an identifying attribute so it's easier to search for that photo.\n\n### Names\n\nWithin the parentheses, tag all relevant people by writing their name separated by commas. This is for a parser's benefit, so first given names (not shortened/nick names) for family members. But full names for uncommon folks, like friends or ward members.\n\n- (scott, hawkins)\n- (charles, raymond, cl duck)\n- ()\n\nLeave the parentheses empty if no one relevant is in the picture.\n\n### Location\n\nAn all lowercase description of the location the picture was taken.\n\n- texascapitol\n- 1104lst\n- grandmashouse\n\nLeave the spot empty if unknown.\n\n### Extension\n\nAnd of course, the extension. Just use `.png`, `.tiff` or whatever.\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: [[202005281049 Unique IDs Make Notes Easy to Find]]"

Second - and subsequent order effects - are the consequences of those first order consequences. Second order thinking is an attempt to look beyond the first order effects and anticipate both the positive and negative second+ order effects.\n\n> \"Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you’ve asked questions and explored\" - *Ray Dalio*\n\nTo train yourself to think in second order and beyond, develop the habit of asking \"and then what?\" If you don't, you have a strong chance of [causing more harm than good][1].\n\nThere are four main reasons people cause problems with only following the first order consequences of their decisions. <!--§202003111938-->\n\n1. Not being trained/aware of second and subsequent order effects\n    - Most things in life happen at the second, third, or nth steps.\n2. A [delay in the feedback loop][2], so consequences are not immediately seen\n    - Confirmation bias makes it easy to willfully not see the detrimental effects our first order effects have on the second order.

A lack of [skin in the game][4]\n    - When you win if things go right, but deal with none of the consequences if things go wrong, you have a strong recipe for disaster.\n\n> A lot of extraordinary things in life are the result of things that are first-order negative, second order positive. So just because things look like they have no immediate payoff, doesn’t mean that’s the case. All it means is that you’ll have less competition if the second and third order consequences are positive because everyone who thinks at the first order won’t think things through. - [fs.blog][5]\n\n### Example\n\n**First order thinking** would be akin to: \"I'm hungry, so I'll eat a candy bar.\" The first order effect is that you would be fed.\n\n**Second order thinking** would be to think through the consequences of eating candy bars every time you're hungry.

You said what you feel, now they say what they feel. Tit-for-tat. And to be honest, it can sometimes get ugly. Don’t take it personally, you’re the one that brought it up for discussion. This is part of the discussion.\n\nYour ONE JOB is to be interested and care deeply about how they feel about it. Take it all with stride. Eventually they’ll get it all out, and their venting of emotions will become less tense feeling. It’s cathartic to be heard, and if you’ve active listened well (practice practice practice), you’ll be rewarded with a closer, more understanding relationship.\n\nActive listening isn’t exactly natural at first. Here are some step-by-steps.\n\n1. Hear their words\n2. Think about what they’ve said\n3. Reflect their *feelings* back at them\n\nThis is to repeatedly show that you understand their feelings. If you successfully have interpreted their feelings, then you’ve done well!\n\nThis is important because you communicate way more back to them by interpreting how they feel, than by telling them what they just told you. By validating their *feelings* correctly, you’re practically egging them on to keep going. They feel like you actually understand them!\n\n### Example\n\n- “You feel like we’re undisciplined with our money.”\n- “You feel like the client won’t care about the hard work we put into generating those reports. It’ll be a ton of work for zero return.”\n- “It’s important for you to keep up with the score, but don’t feel like you have permission to sit down and watch the game.”\n\n## Citations\n\n[[Parent effectiveness training]]"

It's based on reading and understanding charts, so the fundamental principles work the same across all kinds of trades - options, stocks, dividends, commodities, etc.\n\nA chart has [four stages][1] in its cycle - which can be applied to any timeframe (day, weeks, months, years):\n\n1. **Stage 1** - When the stock is at the bottom, not moving up or down\n2. **Stage 2** - When the stock is in an uptrend\n3. **Stage 3** - When the stock is at the top, changing directions\n4. **Stage 4** - When the stock is in a downtrend\n\nThe [best time][3] to buy stocks is when it's transitioning from Stage 1 into Stage 2 at the beginning of the uptrend. Then to sell before it transitions into Stage 4.\n\nYou know when these transitions are happening based on watching the 180 EMA, 200 EMA, and surges in volume.\n\nIf the chart is above *both* the 180 and 200 EMAs, *and* there's a higher than average surge in volume, then it's [extremely likely][2] that a trend is going to happen - most likely, an uptrend.\n\nThis works because it's assumed that the large investment houses use the 180 EMA internally to gauge when to buy. When you see the large surge in volume, you're seeing them throw massive amounts of bull money at a stagnant stock; wrenching it into an uptrend that smaller investors can ride.\n\nSimilarly, you sell based on the same principle. You wait until the \"smart money\" throws large amounts of volume at the chart right as it goes below the 180 EMA line. Once the investment houses get out, it's time for you to get out as well.\n\n## Citations\n\n[[The Complete Position Trading Course]]\n[1]: §202003201341 - Four stages of market cycle\n[2]: §202003201338 - Back-dated analysis of 180 Strategy\n[3]: §202003201342 - Best time to buy stocks"

But unlike stocks, commodities, or similar, an option is placing a bet on what will happen to another stock.\n\nIn practice, the chart looks exactly the same, and the [180 Strategy][1] can work with options just fine. However, there is some difference terms used to describe options in comparison to other kinds of assets.\n\nThe biggest difference is the use of premiums. With options, there is a strike price - which is the insurance you attach to each share you bet on. Say I have bet on 100 shares and there is a strike price of $5 per share. That equals a premium of $500. Then I would have only $500 downside - similar to a stop loss order in stocks - but unlimited upward potential.\n\nSo I would do a calculation of `(8%loss)/(shares)=strike price`. \n\n`($500 losable premium) / (100 shares) = $5 strike price`\n\nAdditionally, options orders all have an expiration date. Because you aren't buying the option right away - instead you're betting that the price will go a certain direction in a certain period of time - you can decide to just walk away from a poorly performing bet by just letting the order expire.\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: [[202003201255 180 Trading Strategy]]\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp\nhttps://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/options-trading-101/\nhttps://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/options-trading-strategies/"

His answer was that he never forced himself to work on anything he didn't want to. In fact, he only did what came easily to him.\n\n> \"When I am stuck for a moment, I leave it and do something else. ... I always work on different manuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.\" - [*Nicklas Luhmann*][2]\n\nBy only [following his interests][3], he was able to perpetually make [forward progress][5]. And because his note taking system [thrived on disorder][4], following his interests made him much better at his career than if he had forced himself down specific holes.\n\n## Citations\n\n[[201908211326 Zettelkasten Method]]\n[[201908211333 How to take smart notes#^03824a]]\n[[202003131332 Growing Up Unschooling with Jayn Coburn#^266271]]\n[[202003072050 A simple definition of Antifragility]]\n[[202003232110 Following interests still needs discipline]]\n[[202003041122 Do systems follow their interests]]"

High level, I want a few things:\n\n1. I want to be able to annotate digital files like they were paper\n2. I want to be able to write/circle/highlight/draw-on any ebook\n3. I want to be able to scatter those notes all over the floor and reorganize them into stacks for spatial organizing\n4. I want everything to sync to the cloud - preferably Google Drive since that's what I use. :) Would prefer not iCloud.\n5. If I'm given a physical piece of paper, I want to very smoothly be able to get a high quality version of it into the iPad to be written on there - the quality needs to be high enough that I could print it with my annotations if needed\n6. Text expander that's ipad-wide (not locked to one single app)\n7. Hook up to my zettelkasten\n\nOkay. I'm not super hopeful, but let's go down the list and see what we can't figure out.\n\n### 1. Annotate digital files like they were paper\n\nThere are plenty of apps that do this. Just find a good one when the time comes.\n\n### 2. Write/circle/highlight/draw-on any ebook\n\nThis is where things start becoming tricky. I did some research into this, and there aren't a lot of options of annotating outside of PDFs. And ebooks are so DRMd that converting them into PDFs isn't always an option.\n\nMy first thought is to find the book in a non-DRM format if at all possible so it can be converted to a PDF.\n\nIf that doesn'xt work, then buy a DRM version of the book - then go onto piratebay and download a PDF version of it.\n\nIf the book isn't available on piratebay, then I'll need to create a workflow around using the built-in text notes for taking notes. Since I'm mostly making little symbols in the margins during my first pass, that's not hard to do. Just highlight and leave an asterisk or silcrow or something. Then on my second pass, I can write \"handwritten\" notes with reference to each. So maybe a [zetel ID][1] (with seconds) for each?\n\n### 3. Scatter those slips on the floor and reorganize them\n\nTwo options here:\n\n1. Find an app that does this\n    - There seem to be a few apps that do this. It's called storyboarding or corkboard, or similar. I want to make sure it can handle hundreds of slips of paper though\n2. Print them out and scatter them on the actual floor\n    - The app I write the notes into needs to be able to bulk export as JPG or something so I can print them bulk with multiple (9-ish) per page to cut out.\n\nI should be able to keep the ebook open in one panel and do the note taking app in the other panel because of the ipad's new feature of multitasking.\n\n#### Paper by WeTransfer\nhttps://paper.bywetransfer.com/\n\nI liek this one because it has the journals feature. It also theoretically can reorganize with \"storyboards\".\n\n### 4. Sync to the cloud - Google Drive\n\nLooks like this isn't a huge deal. Most apps do this, so just be mindful as I'm choosing apps.\n\n### 5. Scanning and annotating physical paper\n\nUse case would be a physical piece of paper handed out by a teacher. Or a flyer from an event. Or a Hillsdale College newsletter. Anything I might want to annotate and turn into a zetel at some point.\n\nTwo options:\n\n1. Snap a photo of the document\n    - I am a quality snob so this isn't my favorite idea. However, there are some pretty good apps out there for capturing and auto-cropping/skew-correcting photos for this very reason.\n    - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-pdf-scanner-app/id333710667#?platform=ipad\n2. Scan it with my scanner\n    - This requires I also have my laptop and scanner with me. Not a huge problem, just a tad less portable. Workflow would be to whip out the scanner and adaptor, scan it, save it as a PDF, sync it to the iPad, open it there, annotate it.\n\n### 6. Text expander\n\n- https://textexpander.com/help/mobile/intro.html - cumbersome apparently\n- https://workflow.is/ - maybe?\n\n### 7. Zettelkasten\n\n- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737172#?platform=ipad\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: [[202005281049 Unique IDs Make Notes Easy to Find]]"

His point was that inherently the market crashes, and it's just a natural state of the market to do so.\n\nI've been bothered by this comment, and I think I know why. There seems to be a misunderstanding of how the stock market works. The implication seems to be that capitalism is unstable and crashes regularly.\n\nI don't believe this is the case. I think that the stock market is doing what it was built to do - correct itself to reflect the actual state of the economy. It's a [negative feedback loop][2] - one that naturally balances to reflect its actual state. This means a stock market crash is a necessary correction, not an abberant flaw in the system.\n\n> The stock market is healing itself - not punishing its users.<!--§202009072007-->\n\nThere is no direct cause-effect in the stock market, it's a large mass of people acting with it simultaneously in a [producer-product][3] model. Every single producer effects the product.\n\n## Example\n\nIn the case of a market crash, the *product* is the crash. That means that there are a lot of moving actors (*producers*) that make the crash occur. Heavy manipulation of the [interest rates and massive stimulus][4] is a producer that distorts the view of the economy. An distorted chart gives the incorrect information to the buyer/seller, so they're buying and selling with false information. Because they can only see the market through teh lens of the distorted chart, it's difficult to see the actual health of the market.\n\nEventually the systemic problems become visible, and the buyers and sellers no longer have confidence in the chart. They [become confused][5] (price discovery) and look elsewhere for information and start to sell off until their confidence is restored. Once their confidence level and the price match, they start to buy/sell as usual, but at a much lower level. Stock market corrected after price discovery.\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: §202003251640 -[[202003232025 What's Behind The Market Meltdown]]\n[2]: \u0003[[201909061140 Negative and positive feedback loops]]\n[3]: [[201908261516 The producer-product relationship]]\n[4]: §202003251700 -[[202003232025 What's Behind The Market Meltdown]]\n[5]: \u0003§202003251657 -[[202003232025 What's Behind The Market Meltdown]]\n[[202003260841 Stock Market as Immune System]]"

If the receiver of your email likes your email, the deposit is returned to your with no penalty. But if the receiver of the email *doesn't* like the email, they press a button that eats up the security deposit.\n\nThat creates a very high cost to writing spam emails. It cuts into the profits significantly.\n\nI also read [an article from Bob Murphy][2] about the role of stock speculators. One thing he talks about is how the people that are *bad* at trading stocks ([according to Taleb][6], the fragile actors) get weeded out because they lose their money. Conversely, the folks that spend the time learning how to trade stocks are [rewarded][3] with enough money to make it worth it to stick around and keep doing what they were doing.\n\nTo be good at trading stocks requires a solid understanding of economics, both technically and fundamentally. Becoming good at this trade means you become a [more knowledged][4] person economically.\n\nBoth these two examples are based on the same principle - making it more expensive to be a bad actor than to be a good actor.\n\nThe cool thing about this is that it's a way that allows anyone to use the system, but the bad actors - the ones not useful to the system - [get weeded out naturally][5].\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: [[Applications of Security Deposits and Prediction Markets]] You Might Not Have Thought About\n[2]: [[The Social Function of Stock Speculators]]\n[3]: [[201909010948 Aggressive gameplay earns big rewards]]\n[4]: §202003252119 -[[Maximize Gains and Minimize Losses]]\n[5]: Non-aggression principle #zt\n[6]: [[Fooled by Randomness]]"

Most of the strategy of the game is learning and applying the knowledge of when to move.\n\nThe system works this way:\n\n- **When you stand still**, you shoot at the nearest enemy at a fixed rate. But you're vulnerable to being hit by an enemy - and in this game, your health is a premium.\n- **When you move**, you avoid being hit be the enemies, but your character no longer shoots.\n\nThe game is interesting at the intersection ([[202007312136 Urban edges spark permaculture magic]]) of running away so you don't get hit and making the decisions of when to hold your ground and defeat the enemy that's attacking you.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[201908271208 Hyper Light Drifter incentivizes reckless play]]\n- [[201909011021 Safety Dance swimming story]]\n\n---\n\nA dynamic mechanic in game design is the trade-off between offense and defense, often realized as the choice to either move or remain stationary. When stationary, a character may perform offensive actions but at the risk of taking damage. In contrast, moving typically enhances defense by avoiding attacks but suspending the character's offensive capabilities. The crux of gameplay in such systems is the strategic decision-making process, where the player must weigh the benefits of attacking against the necessity of evading threats.\n\nThis design principle has been employed in various games, where players must continuously evaluate their position and context to optimize their chances of success. For example, in certain projectile-based games, players must stop to aim and shoot but need to move to dodge incoming attacks. Similarly, certain stealth games require movement to evade detection but necessitate stillness to execute precise actions or attacks. This mechanic, which forces a moment-to-moment reassessment of priorities, enriches the gameplay experience by introducing a rhythmic challenge that requires quick reflexes and forward-thinking.\n\nRelated examples include:\n- Archero\n- Hyper Light Drifter\n- Enter the Gungeon\n- Metal Gear Solid series\n- The Legend of Zelda: [[202004021149 Breath of the Wild]]\n"

Paige feels then in her chest. When I'm uneasy, I always feel it in my gut. Paige has had anxiety attacks that manifest in not being able to breathe well.\n\nI find this interesting because those two places are locations where we have both had respective chronic trauma. For me, I've always had gut problems, and Paige had her unbilical cord wrapped around her neck at birth so had a hard time breathing.\n\nIn [*Dragon Rises*][2], Hammer talks about how the body will manifest symptoms in the area of the body that is the weakest link - not necessarily where the actual problem is occurring. This suggests that those areas of our bodies - my gut and Paige's lungs - are [areas of weakness][3] that could use perpetual support in an attempt to increase the lowest common denominator.\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: [[202003272100 ESRT Elements and Emotions]]\n[2]: [[202002241549 Dragon Rises, Red Bird Flies]]\n[3]: [[201908300555 Yoga naturally strengthens weakest muscles]]"

But in the scriptural context, it's not that simple. The difference is that a covenant between you and God is not as open for flexibility.\n\nThe main bit is that God sets the terms, and you decide to follow it if you want. God sets the stipulations and blessings associated with it, and if you do what he commands/asks, you get hose blessings. [His word][2] is his bond. We can petition Him for specific adjustments to the terms, but the terms *are* set by Him.\n\nThere are two categories of covenants: \n\n1. **Formal ordinances** - Baptism, Sacrament, Endowment, Sealings, Initiatory, etc.\n2. **Specific commandments** - For example, Nephi being [commanded][3] to return to Jerusalem for the Brass Plates.\n\nRegardless of category, a covenant has a set of requirements set forth. Then, with your agency, you decide to do it or not. [The way will be made][3] for you to accomplish the task if you have the faith to follow the commandments.\n\nAlternatively, if you decide not to fulfill your end of the covenant - after choosing to do so with full agency, of course - the consequences can be [dire][4].\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/covenant?lang=eng\n[2]: [[202003170825 Joseph Smith's Revelation on Church Governance]] Doctrine and Covenants 82:10\n[3]: [[202003301733 1 Nephi 3]]:2-7\n[4]: [[202003301739 Acts 5]]:1-11"

Put simply, there are four sub-categories of games that each have limits to their potential. The goal of this game design philosophy is specifically to create infinite replay value with one system rather than relying on other less-interactive methods such as story, skinner-boxes, or increased difficulty.\n\n- **Toy**\n    - Toys are \"sandbox\" environments that have no prescribed goals. The player is free to interact with the elements of the toy with no limits.\n    - Toys are interesting until they are no longer interesting. Typically, once the toy is \"solved,\" the player moves on to another game or toy that is less familiar. \n- **Puzzle**<!--§202009192057-->\n    - A puzzle is simply a toy with a goal prescribed to it. For example, *solving* a Rubik's Cube or *building* a 200-foot tower in [[202312211427 Minecraft]].\n    - Puzzles can be either self-directed or designer directed. Each has their own merits.\n    - The problem here is that puzzles are consumable, and once consumed are no longer interesting. New puzzles must be created.\n- **Contest**<!--§202009232015-->\n    - Contests are toys with a non-binary goal prescribed to it, with the challenge of seeing who can do it the best. Think [[202312251138 Tetris]], 100-yard dash, speedrunning, etc. The goal stays the same, making the focus on who can perform reach the goal better.\n    - Contests are interesting until a level of peak efficiency emerges. While there is technically still room to improve or grow, the contest is at that point essentially \"solved\".\n- **(Clockwork/Strategy) Game**<!--§202009222002-->\n    - A game is a system that perpetually creates decisions that hover in the ambiguous area between the player *knowing the solution* and *making complete guesses*.\n    - This is not a toy because it has a prescribed goal, it's not a puzzle because it is infinitely replayable, and it's not a contest because the goal perpetually shifts to focus on decision making. Puzzles are designed to be solved, and games are designed *not* to get solved.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[202003020831 discovery vs performing]]\n- [[Clockwork game design]]"

Popularly, most people say that *Super Mario Bros.* wasn't released until 1986 when the game was bundled with the NES. Because the bundle was extremely successful, most people got the NES with Mario included and so combine the two events.\n\nThe actual release date is sometime in either October or November of 1985. Either October 14th, October 18th, October 19th or November 17th. Each date has some credibility, but not solid enough to be used officially.\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: [[Super Mario Bros]]\n[2]: [[We Can't Prove When Super Mario Bros Came Out]]"

But simply put, there was an oversaturation of consoles, and low quality games. Combined with how expensive the hardware was, video games were [poison for a toy store][2].\n\nThe *Nintendo Entertainment System* (NES) was released in the USA in [late 1985][2]. Nintendo was releasing to a cold market - no one wanted to get burned by another game console.\n\nNintendo employed an interesting strategy where they launched the NES with R.O.B. the Robot and its associated game [*Gyromite*][3] to make the console feel less like a game console and more like a toy. Combined with high quality games that were almost as powerful as arcade machines, the launch of the NES paved the way for a resurgence of industry wide acceptance and sales.\n\n[*Super Mario Bros.*][4] was bundled together with the NES in late 1986. The bundle sales were great for Nintendo, and so the two of them - the NES and Super Mario Bros. - helped save the video game industry.\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983)\n[2]: [[We Can't Prove When Super Mario Bros Came Out]]\n[3]: [[Gyromite]]\n[4]: [[Super Mario Bros]]"

The parasite will release any of several kinds of toxins into the body of the host that cause horrible acute discomfort.\n\nThe negative symptoms created by neurotoxins, heavy metals, viruses, or similar agents is a much worse feeling than the slow chronic discomfort created by the perpetual leeching the parasite was doing earlier.\n\nIn the long-run though, a short but acute die off is preferable to a chronic leeching of resources.

Because of increasing persecutions and illegal procedures against them by public officers, the Saints had been compelled to leave Missouri. The exterminating order issued by Lilburn W. Boggs, governor of Missouri, dated October 27, 1838, had left them no alternative. In 1841, when this revelation was given, the city of Nauvoo, occupying the site of the former village of Commerce, Illinois, had been built up by the Saints, and here the headquarters of the Church had been established.\n\n1–14, Joseph Smith is commanded to make a solemn proclamation of the gospel to the president of the United States, the governors, and the rulers of all nations; 15–21, Hyrum Smith, David W. Patten, Joseph Smith Sr., and others among the living and the dead are blessed for their integrity and virtues; 22–28, The Saints are commanded to build both a house for the entertainment of strangers and a temple in Nauvoo; 29–36, Baptisms for the dead are to be performed in temples; 37–44, The Lord’s people always build temples for the performance of holy ordinances; 45–55, The Saints are excused from building the temple in Jackson County because of the oppression of their enemies; 56–83, Directions are given for the building of the Nauvoo House; 84–96, Hyrum Smith is called to be a patriarch, to receive the keys, and to stand in the place of Oliver Cowdery; 97–122, William Law and others are counseled in their labors; 123–45, General and local officers are named, along with their duties and quorum affiliations.\n\n## Related zetels\n\n- [[202004061151 My purpose and The Restoration]]\n\n## Link to church website\n\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng"

It needs to go from a structured lecture that is coherent into your brain which just doesn't get it. Those [meaningful connections][4] from the creator of the lecture don't transfer over into your brain, so you need to somehow fit them into your brain's paradigm.\n\nThis is the beginning of the messiness. You need to somehow make sense of what you don't know so you can focus [80% of your energy][2] on the things you *don't* know, rather than studying what other people think you *should* study, even if you already know it. Remember, this is for your understanding, not for someone else.\n\n[Samuel Suresh][1] writes down every [question he has][5], as opposed to the content from the lecture. This becomes a giant list of what he doesn't know, and is a customized roadmap of what he *should actually* study to understand.\n\nHe then organizes those questions into categories, grouping them by concept. Studying then revolves around answering each question within those categories. Those answers can be anywhere - YouTube videos, the textbook, Khan Academy, other lecture notes, random blogs, etc. This is [divergent thinking][3].\n\nThe process of combining and synthesizing all of those scattered concepts into a coherent structure is switching to [convergent thinking][3]. Simplify it down until you can answer the each category in one single zetel. This will probably take several diagrams and scribbled notes to get there, but the information will be yours.\n\n## Citations\n\n[1]: https://youtu.be/n0ql-yeY9u0\n[2]: [[202003030839 Pareto Principle]]\n[3]: [[202004062140 Convergent vs Divergent Thinking]]\n[4]: [[202003041051 Make learning fun for eager minds]]\n[5]: [[201909031446 Afformations Spark Better Change Than Affirmations]]\n[6]: [[202003232032 Inefficiency is where we learn best]]"

They made it into a longitudinal study and tested them at age 10 and 15 as well. The rates dropped dramatically each time - 30% and 12% respectively. When testing adults, only 2% score in the genius level.\n\nWe can - as adults - shift back to the same thinking that those 5 year olds did by understanding how we humans creatively solve problems and innovate. There are two types of thinking:\n\n1. **Divergent Thinking** - Where you imagine possibilities, look at options, broaden your thinking, and look outside the box. ^e70a00\n2. **Convergent Thinking** - Like putting on the brakes. Where you make a judgement, decision, and narrow your thinking to get specific. Criticism. Evaluation. ^9423cb\n\nThese two ways of thinking are in relation to your imaginative problem solving. *Divergent Thinking* is like an accelerator, and *Convergent Thinking* is like putting on the brakes.\n\nWhen we employ both types of thinking at the same time, it's like driving with the accelerator and brake on at the same time. We generate ideas and shut them down simultaneously. This is not productive, and is very limiting.\n\nInstead, we should mimic nature's expansion method ([[202007201050 Gaia’s Garden]]) and think divergently (only) first. Then when we've explored all the possibilities and we want to put it into action, we can slowly start to converge on applicable ideas.\n## Citations\n\n- [Source]: [[202007302012 George Land The Failure Of Success]]\n"

And **On Fire** is when something is truly urgent and must be done quickly.\n\nBy first focusing on the **On Fire** category, then moving into specific contexts for the **Prioritized**/**Important** tasks, you can always remember that everything is on the list for a reason.

The world operates in oscillations between two opposing sides ([[202007221448 Life's ups and downs are normal]]) of a spectrum. Let me explain.\n\nI've been thinking of this in terms of the safety dance ([[201909011021 Safety Dance swimming story]]), where we as humans will leave out comfort zone temporarily to gain an edge ([[201908271208 Hyper Light Drifter incentivizes reckless play]]).

It's a wave looking shape.\n\nIf we were to smooth the wave out to remove the context specific noise, we have something that looks like a sine wave. Sine waves can also be modeled as a rotating circle - a cycle rather than a forward progressing wave.\n\nAnd cycles are repeated in perpetuity. Game loops ([[202007181300 Game loops help players learn]]) are cycles (which, when unwrapped, are arcs of specific activities/goals). Even the Lord has put everything into a pattern of seasons ([[202007171018 God judges us in all seasons]]) and cycles.

[Dan Cook][1] breaks the game loop into four distinct parts: \n\n1. The player has a **mental model** of the system in question \n2. The player **takes an action** based on that mental model \n3. The system **gives feedback** on the action taken \n4. The player **adjusts their mental model** of the system based on the feedback received from the system\n\nThe player repeats this process over and over while participating with the system in an interactive manner. The loop can have fractal ([[202007182058 permaculture shapes]]) loops within it. \n\nFor example, conversations ([[201908281326 Chris Crawford conversation model]]), or playing system based games like chess. \n\nThis is a model of *learning* ([[201908242217 Struggle in learning solidifies knowledge]]). Loops are how we learn the intricate subtleties of an interactive system. \n\n### Arcs \n\n^12870f\n\nArcs are a very similar concept with the same four steps, but rather than being repeated, the player exits the arc once their mental model has been updated. \n\nAn arc can be used to visualize the learning that occurs while participating with linear content ([[201908231506 Explore books like a map for fast learning]]).

Interestingly, they show up in many different scales - often fractally.\n\n### Circles\n\nCircles are the smallest footprint with the most amount of volume. It all radiates from a central equidistant point.\n\n### Spirals\n\nSpirals can be seen in conch shells, sunflowers, and spiraling galaxies. Often, in plants, the spiral is the most efficient way to distribute petals or leaves to gather sunlight and not get in the way of each other.\n\n### Branches\n\nBranches are the most efficient way to distribute resources. The can be found in rivers going to the ocean, as well as in leaves, branches and root systems that need to collect as much sunlight as possible and then redistribute it back out the furthest extents of the tree.\n\nThey are also seen in MLM business models ([[MLM branching business model]]), power/political heirarchies ([[branching structure of power hierarchies]]), and in the structure of the church ([[202007201113 Branching structure of the church]]) leadership.\n\n### Net/mesh pattern\n\nMeshes can be found in spider webs, birds nests, honeycombs and dried mud. It's a pattern that shows up when something needs to be evenly distributed. A triangle mesh is the most efficient way to fit the largest number of seeds in a bed equally distanced.\n\n### Waves\n\nSeen pretty much everywhere, a wave is an oscillation between two extremes. They show up in the ocean, in light waves, in the safety dance ([[201909011021 Safety Dance swimming story]]), in game loops ([[202007181300 Game loops help players learn]]).\n\n## Citations\n\n"

It's described by John Huizinga ([[202008031026 Homo Ludens]]) as the pre-defined marked-off delineation that occurs before play begins.\n\nIt's the agreement between all players that anyone playing will abide by the predefined rules. Animals don't bite to kill. ^04f786\n\nKatie Salen and Eric Zimmerman expand this concept more formally in *Rules of Play* ([[202008031035 Rules of Play]]). They assert that every time a player begins or participates in a game, they enter into a magic circle. Chess players don't cheat.\n\nWhen players break those rules, the magic breaks and the whole facade breaks down. When an animal bites too hard or a chess player cheats, the play abruptly stops.\n\nI've found it to be a useful lens to look at all systems and organizations that we can participate within. We choose to interact with systems and abide by the explicit or implicit rules of that system. The explicit rules of the company you work for, as well as the implicit social and political rules that must be followed to fit in well.\n\nOther examples are the Plan of Salvation ([[202008031205 Magic Circle Plan of Salvation]]) and Social Contracts ([[202008031251 Magic Circle Social Contracts]]).\n\n## Citations\n\n"

In this section, he's talking about how we shouldn't be mimicking the form of forests, but rather the *function* ([[202009071544 Form vs Function]]) of forests. This quote in particular made me recognize that everything in life should *always* be viewed as design elements ([[202008251811 Matthew 7]]) at our disposal. Everything. Always.\n\nFor example, I got all riled up because he mentions that city yards are influenced by all sorts of things, including local ordinances. The libertarian in me - spiraling down the rabbit hole of the immoral application of regulation ([[202008092109 Plants Need Sunlight to Grow Well]]) - doesn't like that.\n\nBut I guess a gardener with slugs eating their lettuce - especially when it's their bread and butter - isn't too keen on slugs either.\n\nIn permaculture, the [phrase attributed to Bill Mollison][4] is \"you don't have a slug excess, you have a duck deficit\". Which means that there's a natural solution to the problem of slugs. They are a tremendous food source for ducks, and conveniently, ducks have more benefits than just eating slugs. So herein lies the a-ha moment:\n\n> Slugs aren't that bad when they're included in the design rather than treated as an enemy.\n\nIn the same way, local ordinances (and everything else you don't like, for that matter) aren't that bad when they're included in the design rather than treated as the enemy.\n\nThe hard-skill here - the tactic to apply - is to view the world through the lens of permaculture. <!--§202008072102-->Let go of seeing things you don't like as enemies who victimize you ([[202002260919 Don't let others control your career path]]), especially when you don't have control over them appearing.

A phase transition is when a complex system is in the process of organizing itself ([[202008022048 Sync The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order]]).\n\nAnd that means edges can be understood as a power curve.

Initially, Satan appears before God, ambitiously proposing to save all mankind and asking for God's honor in return. However, God's Chosen Son, who was with God from the beginning, humbly submits to God's will, leading to Satan's rebellion due to his desire to destroy man's agency and to usurp God's power. As a consequence, Satan is cast down and becomes the devil.\n\nNow on Earth, Satan, in the form of a serpent, manipulates Eve into eating the forbidden fruit, falsely assuring her that she will not die, but instead will gain knowledge of good and evil like a god. After Eve eats the fruit, she also convinces Adam to eat it. Immediately, their eyes are opened, and they realize their nakedness, prompting them to make garments from fig leaves.\n\nWhen God confronts them, Adam blames Eve, and Eve blames the serpent. As a result of their disobedience, God pronounces several curses: the serpent is cursed above all animals, enmity is established between the serpent and Eve's offspring, Eve will experience increased pain in childbirth, and Adam must toil the ground for sustenance. Ultimately, Adam and Eve are expelled from the Garden of Eden to prevent them from eating from the tree of life and living forever in their fallen state. God places cherubim and a flame to guard the path to the tree of life, ensuring mortal life is finite. The chapter concludes with an instruction that these words should only be shared with believers until further command.\n## Related zetels\n- [[202008031205 Magic Circle Plan of Salvation]]\n- [[202009092029 Soil Magic Where Dead Things Revive]]\n\n## Link to church website\n\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/4?lang=eng"

As discussed in the zetel about the magic circle, the idea is that all participants wrap a boundary around themselves that defines the rules of the game. But when the rules aren't actually defined beforehand, but are just decided on the fly, everything is great until someone goes against those implicit rules.\n\nIn society, this is how social contracts come to be. A group of people collectively start to operate a certain way, implicitly following unspoken - or at least legally undefined - rules. To all those participating within the magic circle of the social contract, the rules are explicit. So it's extremely distressing when someone \"cheats\" and breaks the rules.\n\nTo the people that were never following the rules in the first place though, the social contract is not something they ever agreed to. So they're not playing the game, and feel like they've been manipulated against their will ([[202008092109 Plants Need Sunlight to Grow Well]]). This is the basis of the Libertarian movement.\n\nI wonder if it's easier to *not* define the rules of the social contract so that the people playing the game have easier reason to be incensed with the folks that are not - but \"should\" be - playing the social contract game. Anger ([[202003272100 ESRT Elements and Emotions#^c301a0]]) is a motivating feeling, and it would help bring their cause into a sense of justice if they could be angry with everyone that doesn't agree with their views.\n\n## Citations\n\n"

There are four main systems you, as the gardener, have to play with:\n\n1. **Soil**\n    - High quality soil is the required foundation ([[202002272227 Children need rules to be able to play with the rules]]) for growing healthy strong plants. The more organic matter inside it, the healthier the soil is. Your aim is to have spongy, crumbly, humusy soil - a living and rich consistency that can maintain water for long periods of time.\n2. **Water**<!--§202009041442-->\n    - Clean water is a must, but in this case we're talking about large *amounts* of water. You can store that water in several places, but the best place to store it is in the soil. This is done by combining highly absorbent healthy soil with strategic earth contouring such as swales.\n3. **Plants**<!--§202009041444-->\n    - A high biodiversity of plants is important because each plant plays off each other. You should aim for plants that serve more than one purpose ([[201908300524 T-shaped person bell curve]]), as well as a variety of plants that each overlap in their purpose ([[202007151732 Redundancy makes systems stronger]]). This makes the garden itself antifragile ([[201909031411 Antifragile]]) and self sustaining.\n4. **Critters**<!--§202008081347-->\n    - Lastly, your environment will attract many bugs, reptiles, mammals, and other critters. Each one of these is in your garden for an opportunistic ([[201909010948 Aggressive gameplay earns big rewards]]) reason, and when left unchecked, can wreak havok on your garden. However, as the biodiversity of critters increases - as encouraged by the large biodiversity of plants - they keep themselves in check ([[202003251638 Market crash is a correction]]).\n\n## Citations\n\n- Source: [[202007201050 Gaia’s Garden]]\n"

The magic of an ecological garden is to understand how those four elements *interact* ([[202003072212 Game Verbs Guide Player Actions]]) with one another. \n\nSoil stores water, as do plants. Critters can live in the soil, on the soil or fly above it - respectively compsting it, scratching it or pooping on it. Plants consume water, leeching and revitalizing the soil, as well as feed the critters with pollen and fruits. They also shelter all critters that want to live in their shade.\n\nThe greater the variety ([[Zettelkasten is antifragile]]) and density a garden includes, the stronger those connections become. More leaves dropping off of trees means deeper healthier soil. A greater variety of plants also attracts a greater variety of pollinators, insects, birds and mammals. The greater the yield and beauty, the more interest humans have in the garden as well.\n\nIt's the interactions between the four basic elements ([[Clockwork game design]]) that highlight the power of a human designed forest-like garden. The greater the redundancy and overlap, the stronger the garden ([[Antifragile]]).\n\n## Citations\n\n"

Each zone serves a specific purpose, with the lower numbered zones requiring more human intervention. Think of them as a gradient growing from all human in Zone 0 to all wild in Zone 5.\n\n### The zones are as follows:\n\n- [[202009040935 Zone 0]] - <!--§202009041144-->This zone is your living space - typically your house. It's 100% made for humans.\n- [[202009051936 Zone 1 - High-attention]] - <!--§202009051937-->The area of your garden that is the 20 to 40 feet around your door which includes the parts of your garden that you use the most. Think of Zone 1 as the area ([[201908251527 My Patriarchal Blessing]]) that you need the most and the plants need you the most. It can include a play lawn, social space, fresh herbs, favorite berries, beautiful flowers. If going into Zone 1 on a dewy morning gets your feet wet, it's too far from the door. Composting makes sense here.\n- [[202009052020 Zone 2 - Visit a few times weekly]] - <!--§202009052021-->This zone is less cultivated than Zone 1, but still highly cultivated. This is closer to a typical garden area, with crops, raised beds, greenhouses, small barns, maybe a fire pit. This area is designed as an invitation for beneficial wild animals ([[202008012245 Permaculture as a lens]]) such as birds and insects, and can include small agriculture such as ducks, chickens or rabbits. Soil is increased through heavy mulching rather than composting.\n- [[202009052040 Zone 3 - Minimal Attention]] - <!--§202009052042-->Think of Zone 3 as close to a typical farm or orchard. It's less cultivated and maintained ([[201909161327 Give your zettelkasten independence]]) than the previous zones, and is the home of lumber, cash crops, and larger animals such as goats, free-range chickens, or horses. Water is stored out here through clever use of swales. Soil quality is increased over time by planting low maintenance cover crops. \n- [[202009061957 Zone 4 - Minorly Designed]] - <!--§202009061958-->While still designed by humans, Zone 4 is very minimally maintained. This is the forage zone, and can be used for hunting. Think of this as a maintained \"back 40\".\n- [[202009031652 Zone 5 - Nature's wisdom]] - <!--§202008092108-->In contrast to Zone 1, this zone is not made for humans at all. In fact, while the other zones are designed by humans to invite wildness in, this zone is untamed wildness where humans are the visitor. The reason humans come here is to learn from God's systems ([[202007211923 Aligning with Gods Systems]]) in their natural state.\n\nAs you can see, the six zones each progressively invite a bit more wildness into them. Each higher zone correlates with an increasing distance from the home, as well as how much you visit it and how much it needs your input.\n\n## Citations\n\n"

Sectors are forces that come from outside your garden that should to be taken into account when designing. Planning around Sectors can either mitigate or promote the effects of the external force, depending on your design goals ([[202003131332 Growing Up Unschooling with Jayn Coburn]]).\n\nHere are examples of Sectors that would be good to design for:\n\n- The pattern of the sun as it travels across your yard at different times of the year.\n- Paths that animals ([[202008051746 Design Gardens with Nature's Systems for Health]]), such as deer, travel through your yard.\n- The direction of water runoff, as well as where it pools up.\n- Noise pollution from a nearby road or highway.\n- A neighbor's uptairs bedroom window that peeks over the fence into your yard.\n- Your neighborhood's HOA requirements.\n- The direction that a fire could come from.\n- Winter vs. Summer wind patterns\n\nEach one of these elements should be mapped out and planned for holistically ([[201908281435 Functional medicine focuses on uncovering the root cause]]) during the design phase. Combined with Zones, Sectors increase the opportunity to implement a clever multi-function ([[202008061950 Ecological gardens thrive on element interactions]]) solution.\n\nPerhaps a hedge in a well thought out spot could simultaneously block deer, the view from the neighbor's window and dampen a particularly biting northern Winter wind.\n\n## Citations\n\n"

There are a few stages of succession, each serving the purpose of preparing the land for the next step.\n\n- **Bare Earth** - Where it all begins. Naked earth is typically compacted, cannot hold water, susceptible to errosion and not a good environment for growing plants.\n- **Pioneer Stage**\n    - **Short Annuals** - Pioneer plants, typically called weeds, take root in the otherwise inhospitable landscape. Weeds need little water, and therefore opportunistically flood the areas without any competition. These short annual weeds are strong seeders, working to blanket as much ground as possible. As they die off, their roots and composting stems begin the earliest stages of mulching - preparing the land for more robust plants.\n    - **Taller Perennials** - After a year or so, those annual weeds are replaced with taller, hardier perennial pioneer plants - thick stalked weeds, wild flowers, grasses and herbs. These grow much taller, providing shade and deeper roots which protect the soil from evaporation and provide an environment where shrubs can begin to grow. This thick layer of biomass continues the mulching and composting process.\n- **Perennial Shrubs** - Left untouched, after about fifteen or so years, the pioneer stage gives way to thick perennial shrubs which shade out the weeds almost entirely and drive deep thick roots into the earth. The purpose of these robust shrubs is to continue the process of mulching in an even more protected environment, as well as turn up the process by providing shelter for larger - more fertile - animals.\n- **Young Forest** - Another decade or two sees young trees peeking up through the protective layer of perennial shrubs. The trees are the backbone of this young forest, and increase the mulching as well as the animal biodiversity.\n- **Mature Forest** - A mature forest is in a state of constantly fluxing balance. The mature trees create a canopy of protection from wind, sun and extreme weather. It provides the perfect environment for all seven layers of a mature forest to thrive within.\n\nWhile each step follows one after another, the plants that compose that particular step are unique to each environment.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[202008042200 align with nature for thriving gardens]]\n- [[202008092046 Let nature guide your garden success]]\n- [[Gaia’s Garden Gaia’s Garden]]"

I've worried about the individuals in antifragile systems, and wondered how you could pro-antifragility's benefits, while also accepting that competition in the marketplace kills off the actors in the systems all the time.\n\nI have generally just felt sad and hardened by this problem, hoping to uncover some contradictory, positive and all encompassing answer.\n\nBut in this interview, Taleb says that antifragile systems are made up of fragile self-learning actors. The system - say the economy - learns from the fragile mistakes of other actors, and adjusts their course to not meet the same fate. This makes the system more antifragile.\n\nBut it looks like it's a property of the system - it being an organic complex adaptive system ([[202007231120 An Introduction to Complex Adaptive Systems]]) - to be made up of mostly fragile actors that are expendable for the \"greater good.\"\n\nI don't like this answer, and would like to understand (#zt) how this fits into God's plan. I think that an Eternal perspective could give me a better answer, or at least help me understand why this is a positive - or at least important - thing.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [source]: [[Nassim Taleb Talks Antifragile]]\n"

There's an interesting juxtaposition where each plant simultaneously maximizes its own growth ([[202003260841 Stock Market as Immune System]]) while *also* requiring other plants and animals to survive.\n\nThe interconnectedness ([[202003041051 Make learning fun for eager minds]]) of each sphere - temperature, plants, bugs and animals - is what makes the garden stronger.\n\nPollinators ([[202008051746 Design Gardens with Nature's Systems for Health]]) are opportunistically stealing food for themselves, but at the same time are helping those plants mate via their messy thievery. Once those plant's pollinated seeds grow into fruit later in the season, those seeds get picked up by animals ([[202008051746 Design Gardens with Nature's Systems for Health]]) (humans included), or fall on the ground to become compost.\n\nThe composted fruit helps the soil become richer. The stolen seeds get moved to a different location, and often go through the animal's digestive tract unscathed and covered in compost - ready to be brought to life via the rich soil.\n\nThe magic here is that God created all plants and animals to act, solely within their sphere ([[202008121236 God made everything spirit first]]), in an opportunistic ([[202003260841 Stock Market as Immune System]]) way. And at the same time, them acting so opportunistically is what serves ([[202004061407 Serve needy so they're above minimum]]) the needs of the other plants. The system itself is built to thrive on it acting naturally.\n\nAnd because there are so *many* opportunistic elements, everything is kept within reasonable bounds. No one specie of bug can get too big. No one kind of invasive plant can take over. There's always something that can keep the aggressive players in check - even if it takes a season or two to do so.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [8]: [[202008112105 Monopolies Rarely Form Without Help]]"

Another example is a regulated ([[202008092109 Plants Need Sunlight to Grow Well]]) industry like trash pickup or internet providers - that compnay is granted 100% rights to a specific geographic area.\n\nMonopolies don't typically happen naturally, despite the fears that they may. Companies can certainly become large - think Google large - but even in that space, they earned their place at the top and they continue to innovate ([[202004062140 Convergent vs Divergent Thinking]]) to stay there.\n\nBecause large entities are fragile ([[202003072050 A simple definition of Antifragility]]), their dominance is precarious. Smaller, more antifragile entities can come in and chip away at their ankles until the monopoly is dismantled.\n\n## Citations\n\n"

I transitioned rather abruptly to project management by invitation because of really good people soft skills. But I've hit a glass ceiling in my current role. Not able to pick up obvious hard skills like account management, budgeting, timelines, etc.\n\n- Project Management can look extremely different, not only company to company, but also person to person. What does a day-in-the-life-of Grace look like?\n    - Monday tasking note\n    - Hours reconciliation - are we on budget track?\n- The agency I work for is simultaneously scrappy and mature. It's a 15 year old company of mostly senior talent that's established in their lack of structure. Lots of benefits to this, but I've struggled to find a way to grow as a mentee - never any time to mentor. While my job title is Technical Project Manager, I've basically acted as a PM Assistant for a year and a half. What would make you, as the director, want to give someone who has all of the soft skills, but only a year of the experience, a chance? What to highlight, and how to communicate?\n    - Aptitude and good instincts for critical thinking\n    - Unpack a problem, facilite solutions a team\n    - Good client relationships tough conversations\n    - Aptitude for technical conversations\n    - Prioritization\n    - Which kinds of channels work best to get the job done?\n- I'm considering investing in some external training. I'm Scrum certified, which, honestly, taught me most of the hard skills I have. Been looking at Digital Project Manager organization - but also more traditional routes like PMI, etc. Do you have any personal thoughts here? Could the certification help get me over the baseline resume bump?\n    - team gantt\n- If you were in my position, what questions would you be asking?\n    - Definitely get hands on experience so I can put it on the resume.\n    - <!--§202009232011-->Working with other people set goals on open source.

This list of companies include some of the largest brands of our generation - Google, Facebook and their respective subsidiaries such as YouTube, Gmail, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nWhile there is nothing morally wrong with organizing and leveraging such a valuable source of data, it's important to understand where the incentives to push ethical boundaries exist as well as how this ad driven model of revenue causes otherwise good companies to falter. In a very literal sense, a data broker makes money when they sell data they've collected from users. As viewed from this perspective, it's clear that the real customers of companies such as Google or Facebook are the businesses that purchase ads to be displayed on their respective platforms. The typical Instagram or Gmail user is merely a resource to be mined for data.\n\nBecause the needs of the ad buyer are more important to the data broker's bottom line than the needs of the users of the front-facing social media product, there is strong incentive for the broker to collect more and more valuable data to be sold to their ad buyers. What this means in a practical sense is that the broker will collect more sensitive and private data, and expose it in a tantalizing way to the ad buyers - all while obscuring the amount and depth of sensitive data that has been collected so as to not cause users - the data resource - to leave their platform.\n\nThe immense amount of trust given to a large data broker can't be taken lightly. Companies are not inherently \"evil\" as Google famously tries not to be. The incentive to treat their main users as second class citizens is built into the system itself. There are few solutions, none of which are easy.\n\nOne option is to create regulation that puts ethical boundaries around scummy practices. This is the most common solution, as it focuses on solving a tangible, already existing problem. Another is to step away from this business model entirely, a much more difficult task as it requires creating currently unknown business models that will generate just as much revenue as the current ad model.\n\nOut of those two, I personally believe the second option is the more permanent solution as it removes the underlying incentive. While the shift to a non-freemium business model requires sacrificing the benefits of creating a free world-class tool such as YouTube, at least the average user won't be caught in the crossfire of privacy politics, becoming a casualty of unethical incentives."

And the higher the more complicated the mammal's learning needs, the longer they play into adulthood.\n\nBased on the amount of information we're innundated with ([[201909061513 Getting Things Done]]), my conjecture is that we as a culture need to play more ([[202002291650 Play is serious business]]) to stay abreast of everything. This is corroborated by Jonathan Blow in a talk ([[202008171945 Video Games and the Future of Education]]) he gave about the future of education.\n\nHe says that the element that games teach best is the deep-in-the-bones understanding of the underlying systems. He calls it learning \"the spirit\" of the system in question. Ha says that because we live in a global system driven society, learning systems is somewhat an emergency.\n\nPlaying games can fill this need. And not just specific games, but games that allow us to get used to thinking in systems - *PUBG* ([[202008270933 PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]), *Fortnite* ([[202008270936 Fortnite]]), etc.\n\n## Citations\n\n"

As you work to memorize the card, you manually indicate wheter you need to review it **again**, if it was **hard** to recall, if you did **good**, or if it was **easy**.\n\nWhen a new flashcard is introduced and short-term memorization is reached, the interval for review is incrementally pushed further and further out each time it's been recalled successfully. The interval is larger if you indicate good or easy. And saying that you need to review it again, places the card into a **lapsed** state where a short period of intense review occurs.\n\nWhat happens funcionally is that the cards that you memorize easier (for whatever reason) quickly get kicked far into the future since they need less review. And the cards you struggle to memorize are shown to you more often ([[202007081258 Spaced repetition focuses on what is least known]]). Because you focus on the most difficult cards more often, your time is spend more effiently than if you were reviewing a bunch of cards you already know.\n\nThis method is good for memorizing large amounts of data, and being able to hold it in your head for indefinite amounts of time. Personally, I'm using this technique to memorize the Book of Mormon ([[202007081328 Memorizing the Book of Mormon]]). It's one of the methods talked about by Scott Young in *Ultralearning* ([[202007081340 Ultralearning]]).\n\n## Citations\n\n- [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition\n"

I remembered *1 Nephi 1:5* ([[202003011330 1 Nephi 1]]):\n\n> Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people.\n\nIronically, I have this note in my scriptures at that verse: *\"Why did he pray for his people?\"* I'm pretty sure I wrote that in 2014 or something. I vaguely remember it feeling odd that Lehi would feel so compelled to pray *for* his people - people that he didn't know personally.\n\nI think it was a good nudge from God that I was the one out of sync then. I think I get it now. The world needs genuine prayers, and my heartache and desire for peace for my frends and my family can be a driver for that.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [2]: \"Sarah's feeling drained just worrying about where this is headed, especially for the sake of our children.

If you walk on the one moving in the direction opposite to where you are headed, you will expend more energy than is necessary.

If you walk in the direction you are going while standing on the sidewalk that is also moving in that direction, you make it to your destination with a normal amount of expended energy, but much faster!\n\nSo it is with any system we operate within. We must understand the flow of the system fundamentally so that we may be able to align ourselves with it ([[202008042200 align with nature for thriving gardens]]).\n\nThe moving sidewalk is a simple example because it's a simple system. But how do you know if you're aligning with a system that is much more complex? You must spend the time to get to know the system, learn to feel the system ([[202008171945 Video Games and the Future of Education]]).

These guilds are built to mimic natural communities ([[202007201050 Gaia’s Garden]]) of plants found in forests.\n\nA guild is typically built around a central plant - a tree or large bush - with as many supporting plants packed in around it. For example, you might plant herbs or flowers that attract specific kinds of pollinators, or predators that eat pests which notoriously attack the central tree.\n\nA ring of perennial asparagus might be planted to keep grass from coming near the base of the tree. Strawberries might be planted to be a mulching groundcover. Nitrogen fixers, etc.\n\nThe combinations of plants are informed by seeing what kinds of plants naturally group together in nature.

Whereas Zone 5 is 100% nature, Zone 0 is 100% domesticated. Nature is not invited by default, and when it *is* invited in, it plays by *your* rules.\n\nZone 0 is your living space, and has many psychological factors to keep in mind. It's the place that must feel safe and secure. It needs to meet your Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs ([[202009082231 Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]) - sleep, security, food, friendship, etc.\n\nAgain, Zone 0 being on the polar opposite side of the spectrum from Zone 5, we can take a another lesson from there. If Zone 5 is designed by nature, then Zone 0 is designed by you. It must server your needs before it serves anthing elses.\n\nFor example, using permaculture as a lens ([[202008012245 Permaculture as a lens]]) to make sense of other domains, we could apply zones to a single person. Zone 0 would be your individual space. It should be a safe, recharging space that doesn't require catering to other people's needs - maybe your bedroom or work desk.\n\nThe more people you interact with regularly, the smaller you individual space may be. But it's personal and should not be intruded on by anyone or anything else. Zone 0 is your personal sacred space. At its smallest, it's your own agency, which can never be intruded upon.\n\n## Citations\n\n- §202008072059 -[[Gaia’s Garden Gaia’s Garden]]"

I'd like to posit that competition exists because there are gaps in the system ([[202311280039 THIS IS MARKETING]]) that opportunistic entities rush in to fill. The larger the gap, the larger the competition. The smaller the gap, the smaller the competition and the greater the cooperation.\n\nThis can be seen in a garden. If the garden has less biodiversity and there are not many lady bugs, then aphids have a veritable buffet of food to chomp on and no predators - there is a large gap in the system that they go and exploit. The aphids are competing hard. With the influx of aphids though, lady bugs can thrive and so they also come in with a force. Both very noticeable, in a World War sort of way. A huge pendulum swing one direction is countered with a huge pendulum swing the other direction.\n\nBut when the balance is achieved between aphids and lady bugs - which is an ever fluctuating wave ([[202007182058 permaculture shapes]]) rather than a static balance (but a much smaller amplitude than the above mentioned pendulum swing) - then the competition between them is less dramatic. Perpetual squabbles on a tribal scale rather than world wars ([[202009082229 Taxes make World Wars possible]]).\n\nIn a broader scale, invasive plants can only be invasive if there is a gap to fill. If the gap is too crowded, then a greater variety of plant species can only take smaller bits of the overall pie. But here is where the magic occurs!\n\nOnce they are no longer fighting for their survival, they naturally start supporting each other by attracting mutually beneficial pollinators, offering shade, water storage, etc. The pie that supports the huge variety of plants increases in size for everyone - creating a strong middle-class ([[202009082230 The Middle Class]]) of sorts - and even though the percentage of the pie is smaller per capita, the per capita is still very abundant and helpful ([[202009031639 Plants help each other grow better]]).\n\n## Citations\n\n"

The healthier the soil, the greater its water retention abilities.\n2. **In swales**: Swales are a good way to dam off water so it soaks into the healthy soil and travels slower through the soil rather than running off on the surface. Well designed swales will guide water to where it needs to be without the need for mechanical systems.\n3. **In plants**: Plants hold water ([[202008051746 Design Gardens with Nature's Systems for Health]]). Some hold more water than they need and can push water back into the soil when the soil gets too dry. Fallen mother trees store a ton of water in them.\n4. **In the shade**: Shade prevents the sun from baking the water out of the soil. While some plants like more sun than others, dry dirt is never beneficial.\n5. **In mulch**: Mulch is basically the go-between. Mulch is ground up plants, placed in swales, creates shade for the underlying dirt, and becomes soil over time.

As we learned early on in the book, the natural state of the planet is to become forest ([[202008092046 Let nature guide your garden success]]) - given enough water and sunlight, of course.\n\nSo it makes sense that the natural state of a garden designed to imitate and piggy-back on the forces of nature ([[202008042200 align with nature for thriving gardens]]) would also be a forest.\n\nA simple way to think of how to design a food forest is to think of it as macro level guilds - each area of the food forest is a guild ([[202009031616 Mimicking forests with permaculture guilds]]) surrounding a tree. In fact, you can think of a food forest as a series of guilds that are propped up by a backbone of trees.\n\nBy first creating a skeleton of trees to frame what the food forest will become, you not only create guidance of what to plant where (mimicking communities), but you also increase the vertical space of your garden.

Just go study up in your Zone 5 ([[202009031652 Zone 5 - Nature's wisdom]]), then create a backbone of trees ([[202009062032 Food forests mimic nature's own gardens]]) that will make up your food forest.\n\nBut in other environments that don't traditionally look or act like forests, this doesn't work as well. For example, it's difficult to grow a half acre forest in your 200 sq.ft. yard in the middle of the city, and it's *impossible* to do so on a postage sized apartment balcony in London. This is where understanding the difference between the *form* of a forest and the *function* of a forest is useful. \n\nMimicking the form of a forest is relatively simple - do what nature does ([[202008042200 align with nature for thriving gardens]]) exactly. You dont really even need to know why it works because the natural systems in place take care of the rest.\n\nIn contrast, designing a garden through understanding the *function* of a forest requires an understanding of how those systems work ([[202003232032 Inefficiency is where we learn best]]) under the hood. It means you've done your homework in a fundamental, principle based, sort of way rather than a surface level understanding of nature's tactics.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[202007201050 Gaia’s Garden]]"

Each plant serves multiple functions\n2. The garden as a whole has lots of redundancy ([[202007151732 Redundancy makes systems stronger]]) in those functions\n\nSo beans shouldn't be used solely because they grow beans - this is just scratching the bare minimum. Instead, you should be looking to incorporate the nitrogen fixer around nitrogen hungry plants like corn ([[202009031639 Plants help each other grow better]]) and put it on a trellis that will create shade and block wind.\n\nAdditionally, beans shouldn't be the only nitrogen fixer you have planted. There should be several others planted in case the beans don't serve their purpose as designed. Similarly, there should be other plants that reduce the extreme winds or create shade.\n\nThis built in redundancy increases the antifragility ([[Antifragile]]) of the garden as a whole, and allows for failures in the individaul parts of the garden while the rest of the garden stays strong. This is how nature does it ([[202008042200 align with nature for thriving gardens]]) in a forest, and if it's good enough for God ([[202007211923 Aligning with Gods Systems]]), it's good enough for me.\n\n## Citations\n\n"

It's a process that involves pushing through the natural ecological stages of succession rapidly. In the same way that fighting against the natural clock of succession ([[202008092105 Ecological Succession]]) (eg. keeping a well maintained lawn) takes significant energy, so to does pushing the succession faster ([[202009021853 Align with the flow of the system]]) than what is natural take a significant amount of energy.\n\nHowever, the reward for pushing *forward* - as opposed to wrenching it *backward* - is that you get the results of a forest much sooner than you would have otherwise. Instead of a forest growing across 40 years, you could get similar results in 15 to 20.\n\nOnce you reach a certain point of density and maturity ([[The Tipping Point]]) in a forest, the natural systemic mechanisms finally have more momentum ([[202009072003 Flywheel Concept]]) than your manual input can keep up with. This is the really exciting time! This usually happens around years 5 to 10.\n\nAll the systems are interacting in full force. Your soil regenerates itself, the insects and birds keep eachother in check, the flowers bloom without your continued coaxing and the fruit trees are so loaded with fruit you don't know what to do with it ([[202007201050 Gaia’s Garden]]).\n\nThis is the natural expression of a healthy garden ([[202003251638 Market crash is a correction]]), and it's beautiful.\n\n## Citations\n\n"

The outward expression of a principle may look completely different on the outside - a vertical garden on an apartment balcony looks nothing like a forest, for example - but it can serve the same *purpose* as a forest. In fact, it might be *more* impactful because your little garden may be the only oasis for attracting/fostering biodiversity in a large radius.\n\nThis is impactful to me because it highlights that change - even a dramatic departure from the norm - will always present opportunities to serve ([[202004061407 Serve needy so they're above minimum]]).

It is built as a process that functionally makes agile actionable. It does this through a series of artifacts, ceremonies amd team structure:\n\n### Artifacts\n\n- **User Stories** ([[202009122103 User stories guide project goals]]): The unit of work that needs to be done. It's written with a specific format so as to make the work focus on the user rather than the engineering solution.\n- **Backlog**: A list of all the user stories - prioritized and pruned by the Product Owner regularly.\n- **Sprints**: A set period of time for a complete deliverable to be completed within. Usually 2 to 4 weeks long.\n\n### Ceremonies\n\n- **Daily Scrum (Standup)**: As short daily meeting (15 min. max) where the team syncs up. The focus is on the progress of the stories, not the team member.\n- **Sprint Planning**: An all hands meeting where the top of the backlog is pulled into the sprint.\n- **Sprint Review**: At the end of the sprint, an all hands meeting where the client gives feedback on the previous sprint's delivered work.\n- **Sprint Retrospective**: An all hands meeting where the team discusses what worked and what didn't in the previous sprint. It's a vulnerable time to WOOP ([[202009122052 WOOP Process]]) and make real change.\n\n### Team\n\n- **Product Owner**: The person that is in charge of the direction of the product.

It's an easier sell to clients and it's easier to understand on paper.\n\nIf the project's requirements are predefined and won't change (government projects, for example), then Waterfall is ideal because it doesn't have as much overhead as Agile.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[202009101711 Week 1 PM Essentials & Project Tools]]\n"

The *Save the Cat!* ([[202009131419 Save the Cat! Writes a Novel]]) outline is a character transformation machine, and only works if you have a character that changes. There are three main elements to nail:\n\n1. A Problem (or flaw that needs fixing)\n2. A Want (or goal that the hero is pursuing)\n3. A Need (or life lesson to be learned)\n\n### A Problem\n\nFixate on a main *flaw* or two that cripple your main character. They need to have enough potential that it's obvious they need to change. Pride, shopaholic, alcoholic, a coward, bitter. Don't let that problem stay contained to one area of their life, it needs to seep.\n\n### A Want\n\nThis is something external/tangible they really really *want*, and they need to proactively be trying to get it. The kicker here is that the hero thinks the external want is going to fix their problems (because of their narrow thinking and limited worldview). But in reality it won't fix their problems.\n\n### A Need\n\nJust as in real life, the hero doesn't really know what will bring them happiness and fix their problems. That's what the *need* is for, to be the real answer to their problems. But it's like a persistent thorn in the hero's side that they really really don't want to do, or accept, or put into practice.\n\n<!--§202009132034-->Conveniently, this need is also the theme of the book.

While they don't necessarily need to make the decision explicitly here - that happens in the Dark Night of the Soul ([[202009161603 Dark Night of the Soul]]) - they need to look in the mirror and be painfully aware of their real need-driven predicament.\n\nIt's easier to make have this reflection when the hero's A story and B story cross paths. For example, in Casablanca ([[Casablanca]]), the midpoint happens when Rick is forced to face his bitterness as his B Story long-lost-love shows up in his neutral A Story bar begging him to take political sides.\n\n## Citations\n\n"

In an attempt to simplify things a bit, let's summarize ([[202009132005 15 Story Beats]]):\n\nAct 2 as a whole is about being the opposite of Act 1 ([[202009142104 Act 2's new world challenges the hero]]) so the hero has the opportunity to grow. From a plot perspective, there is going to be either an upward or downward trajectory that see-saws right in the middle ([[202009152154 Midpoint Beat]]) with either a False Victory or False Defeat, respectively. The first part of that see-saw happens in the Fun and Games ([[202009152103 Fun and Games Beat]]) and the latter happens in the Bad Guys Close In ([[202009161528 Bad Guys Close In Beat]]).\n\nHowever, regardless of the plot events, the midpoint ([[202009152154 Midpoint Beat]]) raises the stakes of the *internal bad guys* - the internal flaws ([[202009132031 Characters Must Change for Gripping Stories]]) that never seem to go away. This is the constant of the Bad Guys Close In beat: **the increase and ultimate culmination of the hero's internal flaws**.\n\nTo make this happen, there should be a shift from the plot focusing on external wants to putting an emphasis on how the character's internal flaws are keeping the them from getting what they want. It's not Rick's old fling ([[Casablanca]]) that's causing problems, it's his unwillingness to pick sides in a World War that's causing his unhappiness.\n\nThis should be increasingly frustrating to the hero, and will culminate in the hero losing everything in the next beat ([[202009161529 All is Lost beat reveals true weakness]]).\n\n## Citations\n\n\n[[202009131419 Save the Cat!

No more playing nice to your hero. The purpose of this beat is to show the hero at their lowest point - the absolute rock bottom ([[202003132216 Men's Hearts Shall Fail Them]]).\n\nTypically, this can be achieved through the **whiff of death**. Even if no one actually dies, the whiff of it can be as effective. Nothing speaks despair more than death, amirite?\n\nBreak your character. ALL. IS. LOST. Really. When brainstorming ideas about what should be the hero's lowest moment, think of the thing that matters most to your character, and then take it away from them. Don't pull that punch, or you'll lose the power of the story.\n\nThe event of the All Is Lost beat should be your character's fault, at least in part. It should highlight that the stubborn fool has not fixed their internal flaws ([[202009132031 Characters Must Change for Gripping Stories]]), and they're partly to blame for their horrible misfortune.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[202009131419 Save the Cat!

The hero finally *finally* sees where they've been doing things wrong and they know what they need to do to change.\n\nBut before they get to the epiphany, you should have them basically give up for a bit. Have them step back into the Act 1 world ([[202009142031 Hero's quest for a better life begins]]) (or at least try to) - they need to find some comfort in the familiar. And in that relative comfort, they can have their epiphany which leads them into Act 3 ([[202009162042 Act 3 shows hero's true change]]), the synthesis world.\n\n## Citations\n\n- [[202009131419 Save the Cat!

The one difference is you know that there will be a solution ([[201908221744 Games Engage but Limit Learning Opportunities]]), because it's a game.\n2. This replayability of games is a newfangled concept with the dawn of consumption of games as linear storytelling ([[202007181300 Game loops help players learn]]). Puzzles are part of the content treadmill, and that's what causes this problem in the first place.\n\nEither way, I think he captures a similar sentiment I have.

In his opening address at the 89th Semiannual General Conference of the Church, on October 4, 1918, President Smith declared that he had received several divine communications during the previous months. One of these, concerning the Savior’s visit to the spirits of the dead while His body was in the tomb, President Smith had received the previous day. It was written immediately following the close of the conference. On October 31, 1918, it was submitted to the counselors in the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Patriarch, and it was unanimously accepted by them.\n\n1–10, President Joseph F. Smith ponders upon the writings of Peter and our Lord’s visit to the spirit world; 11–24, President Smith sees the righteous dead assembled in paradise and Christ’s ministry among them; 25–37, He sees how the preaching of the gospel was organized among the spirits; 38–52, He sees Adam, Eve, and many of the holy prophets in the spirit world who considered their spirit state before their resurrection as a bondage; 53–60, The righteous dead of this day continue their labors in the world of spirits.\n\n## Related zetels\n\n- [[202009202209 Plan before adding to Zettelkasten]]\n\n## Link to church website\n\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138"

There are simply too many unknowns to make a useful plan. This is called the \"planning horizon,\" and is a very useful limit to keep in mind so you can be more honest about the plan's details ([[202010062100 Be honest in your planning]]).\n\nThis is a very similar conecept to Keith Bergun's Strategy Game horizon ([[202003311037 Clockwork game philosophy builds infinite fun]]) as explained in his book *Clockwork Game Design* ([[Clockwork game design]]). Essentially, there is a sweet spot created by the game designer that the player cannot see past. This might be a view distance, a number of moves in the future, etc. The point is that the player must use their heuristic knowledge ([[202002272227 Children need rules to be able to play with the rules]]) to continually plan for the best scenario despite only having limited knowledge.\n\nThis makes planning a project very much like a complex strategy game. You have heuristics, but not full clarity of what the future will bring. So acknowledging that you can't see any further ahead than reality dictates allows you to make best guesses with confidence - full well knowing that you'll need to change the plan ([[202009282012 Project planning is a process]]) as more information crosses past the threshold into your horizon.\n\n## Citations\n\n"

Prefacing the record of this vision, Joseph Smith’s history states: “Upon my return from Amherst conference, I resumed the translation of the Scriptures. From sundry revelations which had been received, it was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of man had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled. It appeared self-evident from what truths were left, that if God rewarded every one according to the deeds done in the body the term ‘Heaven,’ as intended for the Saints’ eternal home, must include more kingdoms than one. Accordingly, … while translating St. John’s Gospel, myself and Elder Rigdon saw the following vision.” At the time this vision was given, the Prophet was translating John 5:29.\n\n1–4, The Lord is God; 5–10, The mysteries of the kingdom will be revealed to all the faithful; 11–17, All will come forth in the resurrection of the just or the unjust; 18–24, The inhabitants of many worlds are begotten sons and daughters unto God through the Atonement of Jesus Christ; 25–29, An angel of God fell and became the devil; 30–49, Sons of perdition suffer eternal damnation; all others gain some degree of salvation; 50–70, The glory and reward of exalted beings in the celestial kingdom is described; 71–80, Those who will inherit the terrestrial kingdom are described; 81–113, The status of those in the telestial, terrestrial, and celestial glories is explained; 114–19, The faithful may see and understand the mysteries of God’s kingdom by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\n## Related zetels\n\n- [[202009092029 Soil Magic Where Dead Things Revive]]\n\n## Link to church website\n\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76"

Often, the main barrier to signing the contract is that there is no clear budget. The estimate makes tangible a concept that has so far been vague - whether or not the project is worth it for both the client and agency to engage in.\n2. Estimates **provide clarity** to an intangible process, and therefore **guide the approach**. Once it's clear how much the budget will be, it's possible to start tweaking the three knobs (scope, time, budget) to make the project a possibility.\n3. **Estimates dictate the amount of resources**. Most of the money in your budget you have goes directly to the development team in the form of wages. To maintain a profitable margin, your development team is limited to the amount you can pay them.\n\n## Citations\n\n#zt"

Link, through his repeated interventions enabled by the Song of Time, parallels the Bodhisattva’s compassionate struggle within these cyclic existences ([[202007181300 Game loops help players learn]]).
